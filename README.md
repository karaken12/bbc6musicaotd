# BBC 6Music AotD
## BBC 6Music Album of the Day manager

This project is designed to catalog and manage the Album of the Days of BBC 6Music.

**I am not affilliated with the BBC or 6Music, and I do not take credit for their music selections.**

This project started in 2015, but the Album of the Day has been going a long time,
and I've managed to get incomplete data going back to 2009.

So far this project generates a static site, and stores all the relavent data in YAML files.
This may change in the future, to create a more dynamic site.
Also for the future is more Spotify integration.

I have no affilliation with Spotify, except that that's what I use to listen to music, so that's what I'm using here.
If you'd like to suggest integration with another streaming service, or better yet, write some code to do that, just let me know.

Contributions, comments, and suggestions gratefully recieved.
